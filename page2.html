          Welcome to <strong>Sweet Frost Ice Cream</strong> – the
          place where every scoop is made with love, passion, and a
          touch of magic!
        </p>

        <p>
          Our journey began in 2020, in a small kitchen filled with
          big dreams. We wanted to create ice cream that not only
          tastes amazing, but also makes people smile. That dream
          became <strong>Sweet Frost</strong> – a family-owned ice
          cream shop that quickly grew into a beloved local favorite.
        </p>

        <p>
          At Sweet Frost, we believe in using only the best
          ingredients. That means fresh milk and cream, real fruit,
          and natural flavors. No artificial colors or preservatives –
          just pure, delicious ice cream the way it should be. Every
          batch is made with care by our team of skilled ice cream
          makers.
        </p>

        <p>
          We offer over 30 flavors, including classics like
          <em>chocolate</em>, <em>vanilla</em>, and
          <em>strawberry</em>, as well as unique creations like
          <em>blueberry cheesecake</em>, <em>caramel popcorn</em>, and
          <em>honey lavender</em>. We also make seasonal specials and
          even vegan and dairy-free options, so everyone can find
          their favorite treat.
        </p>

        <p>
          But Sweet Frost is more than just ice cream. It's a place
          for families, friends, and community. We host local events,
          support schools and charities, and love seeing our customers
          come back again and again.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our mission is simple: to make people happy, one scoop at a
          time. Whether you're celebrating a birthday, going on a
          first date, or just need something sweet after a long day –
          we're here for you.
        </p>
